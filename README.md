In this assignment I created a Swing application that simulated a police communication system that includes managing the picking up and detaining of suspects. This project helped me gain an in-depth understanding of multi-threaded Swing applications.

The assignment specification is included in a PDF.

I've uploaded my entire Ecplipse Workspace so it should be easy to download and run.
